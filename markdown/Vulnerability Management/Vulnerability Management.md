# Package lifecycle management - how we stay on top of vulnerabilities

As distributed, microservice architectures grow in popularity and the volume of open source solutions increase there is an increase in the use of tooling. 



### Why is it important? 
Threats through 3rd party packages & libraries are increasing. 
DevOps principles
A core component of patching vulnerabilities in an application is knowledge of the existence of the vulnerability. However, many developers lack insight into the full array of third-party code that their applications depend upon.

Transitive vulnerabilities are key as well. 

> Key Point: Staying safe & secure is a *shared* responsibility

### What do we need to consider? 
Process for active development and in-situ in production.

What am I developing now
What is in source control
What is running in production/non-production

Considerations depending on branching strategy.

> Key Point: Both tool & process

### Give me an example
- How do we reduce overhead
- Notifications
- SLA/Reporting

### What I'm developing now
```plantuml
@startuml
start
repeat :Coding Feature;
    #Gold:Check-in;
    #Gold:Build package;
    #Gold:Scan;
    note right: Including transitive dependency scan
backward: Fail build - notify;
repeat while (Critical or High vulnerabilities?) is (yes)
#Gold:Build passed;
#Gold:Code merged to main;
stop

@enduml
```

### What is in source control
```plantuml
@startuml
start
#WhiteSmoke:Scheduled Trigger;
:Build Package;
:Scan;
note right: Including transitive dependency scan
If (Critical or High vulnerabilities) then (yes)
    :Create pull request with proposed update;
    :Trigger build & tests;
    :Create JIRA ticket and assign to team;
    #LightSkyBlue:Team review and merge request;
    #LightSkyBlue:Follow usual SDLC to test merge and schedule for production;
else (no)
endif    
stop

@enduml
```

> Key Point: Maintain responsibility, but minimise overhead with automation. 

### Changes to consider

Snooze issue option - when no remedy for a CVE exists

> Key Point: Need owners to think about what is next.
